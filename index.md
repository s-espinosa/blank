title: Second Shift Curriculum
---

The content on this site is part of Turing's Second Shift program. Each course is designed to last six weeks with two sessions each week. We also have a full-time program for both front end and back end engineering. For more information on those programs, please visit our [main site](https://www.turing.io/">Turing site)

Most of the resources here are geared toward our students but the curriculum is available for anyone to view and learn from.

If you're interested in learning more about our program and mission, check out the main <a href="https://www.turing.io/">Turing site</a>.
